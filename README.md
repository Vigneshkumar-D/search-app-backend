# Data Search Application - Backend

## Overview
The backend of the Data Search Application is responsible for handling data retrieval, data upload, and database interactions. It provides RESTful APIs to support the frontend functionalities such as searching for user data and uploading data files containing user information.

## Features
1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Provides endpoints to retrieve user data based on specified parameters such as name, age, email, country, or mobile number.
   - Returns search results in JSON format to the frontend for display.

2. **Data Upload**:
   - Supports endpoints for uploading data files containing user information.
   - Processes the uploaded files, extracts user data, and stores it in the backend database for future retrieval.

3. **Database Interaction**:
   - Utilizes Spring Data JPA along with Hibernate for database interactions.
   - Stores user data in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implements robust error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully.
   - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in case of errors during data retrieval or upload.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies the implementation of JPA-based repositories.
- **Hibernate**: An object-relational mapping (ORM) tool for Java applications, used for database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database management system used for storing user data.

## Development Environment
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: An integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development.
- **Maven**: A build automation tool used for managing dependencies and building the project.
- **Git**: Version control system for managing source code changes.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the backend repository of the Data Search Application from the version control system (e.g., GitHub) to your local machine using Git:
     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**:
   - Open a terminal and change the directory to the backend folder of the cloned repository:
     ```
     cd searchApp
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required dependencies for the backend using Maven:
     ```
     mvn install
     ```

4. **Configure Database**:
   - Set up a PostgreSQL or any other compatible database instance.
   - Create a new database for the application and configure the database connection properties in the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the backend application by running the main class or using Maven:
     ```
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
   - The backend application will start and listen for incoming requests on the configured port (usually port 8080 by default).

## API Documentation
- API endpoints and request/response formats are documented in the codebase using Swagger or other similar tools.
- Access the API documentation through the `/swagger-ui.html` endpoint when the backend application is running.

## Conclusion
The backend of the Data Search Application provides essential functionalities for data retrieval and upload, ensuring seamless communication with the frontend and efficient data management. With its robust features and reliable technologies, the backend aims to support the overall goals of the application in providing users with a powerful tool for managing and analyzing user data.
